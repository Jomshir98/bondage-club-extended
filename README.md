# ![logo](resources/BCX_small.png)  Bondage Club Extended (BCX)

An extension for the Bondage Club online game ([https://www.bondageprojects.com/club_game/](https://www.bondageprojects.com/club_game/)) by Jomshir98, one of the club's coders.

It enhances the experience in the club with many new features, especially more options for slaves/submissives and their owners/dominant play partners.

The extension can, among other things, be considered a continuation of Ace's wonderful [cursed script](https://github.com/ace-1331/ace12401-cursedscript), providing similar features. Ace recently announced that the development of Curse will be stopped. Jomshir98, who was also a contributor to the cursed script's github, offered to take over the development to not let Curse die due to incompatibility with new club versions. At the same time, the goal was to remake the underlying design from the ground up, to make the script more future proof. Therefore, the decision was to integrate curse features into the bondage club extended script.

This has several advantages: There is no longer any need to install a browser addon and keep it up-to-date. BCX is a simple script, where the latest version can automatically be run with a loader in the console or via a browser bookmark (see section ['running the script'](#running-the-script)). Moreover, the new design will make it easier to configure and expand the extension with new exciting features. Configuration data is bound to your Bondage Club account and will be shared between different devices, but not between different accounts.

BCX is a complete remake of Jomshir98's previous [JMod](https://github.com/jomshir98/testing) which was basically all about testing features Jomshir developed for the bondage club, before they were even part of any bondage club betas, such as BEEPs with messages attached or icon-based room movement.

The extension is very modular and highly customizable. These are currently planned modules and their current development status:

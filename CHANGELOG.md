 - Added a utility-command `.deck` that has 4 subcommands to draw, deal or shuffle with a standard 52-card game deck

This update includes:
 - Rules, rules and even more rules!
   - New rules module - currently with 44 rules to use. Gotta try 'em all !~
   - Each rule has name and detailed description plus some also quite extensive configuration options
   - The rules range from rules blocking actions, interacting with speech or even altering how Bondage Club works to some degree
   - A limit system to limit and/or block rules that feel too intense or just not to your liking
   - Some rules are limited or blocked by default
   - 4 new permissions in the authority module allow you to configure who can use normal and/or limited rules, configure rules triggers and change which rules are limited/blocked.
   - Most rules can be set to add a log in the behaviour log when broken (to enable this feature see "Log every misbehaviour detected by rules" option in behaviour log configuration)
 - New contextual help buttons
   - On most views, there is now a `(?)`-Button right below the exit/back button that summarizes what the view is about
 - Member number input fields are enhanced with a button that leads to a subscreen with a filterable list of names from BC(X) relationships, friendlist and current chat room for selection, instead of having to enter the member number manually
 - Improved the green/yellow/red colors used by the limit/block curse slots and rules view towards better text readability - Note for users with color blindness: the light-dark order of the three colors was reversed; the softest color now means "blocked"
 - Improved usability of the wardrobe export/import feature by allowing to import items, while wearing locked items, if none of the locked items will be changed by import (useful if you are wearing some permanently locked item, like piercings)

Fixes:
 - Fixed a bug which deleted the saved color information of a cursed item, which made it reappear in an unexpected color when triggering the curse would reapply it
 - Compatibility fixes with "Bondage Club Tools" extension
 - Player presence checkbox now properly detects when it can be used

## 0.5.2

Fixes:
 - Crash when curses module has been disabled

 - Authority Module GUI: The permissions and roles views have been swapped so that the main menu first leads to the role one
 - Authority Module Permissions GUI: Permissions from different modules now start on a new page, making it look more clean

 - When looking on someone else's BCX main menu, their BCX version is displayed, too
 - Added Discord invite to the main menu

## 0.5.0

**Breaking change:**
Code behind curses changed significantly. Current curses will be migrated to new version, but current curse-related permissions won't!

   - Trigger conditions, determining if a curse should be in effect or not
   - Ability to mark curse slots as normal/limited/blocked
   - Timer to automatically deactivate or remove a curse
   - Ability to manually disable a curse without removing it
   - Global trigger conditions configuration that applies to all curses
   - Global timer configuration that applies to new curses
   - Accompanying new permissions, log and chat messages as well as chat commands
 - Chat commands are now saved in chat entry history

Fixes:
 - Curses now properly ignore things like locks, even if properties aren't cursed

 - Added BCX version information and external link to the changelog in the BCX main menu

Fixes:
 - Reduced transparency of the BCX icon over the in-game characters for better visibility on various room backgrounds
 - Fixed how the command trigger was displayed in the chat commands help for the user

## 0.4.0

This update includes:
 - A whole new chat command system to interact with BCX users, even if you don't have BCX!
   The new commands can be seen by whispering `!help` to any BCX user.
   You can use most of the commands on yourself too. To see those, use `.help` in chat.
 - Added tutorial message for chat commands. This will not display for current users, so to give you the contents:
> BCX also provides helpful chat commands.
> All commands start with a dot ( . )
> The commands also support auto-completion: While writing a command, press 'Tab' to try automatically completing the currently typed word.
> Other club members can also use commands of your BCX, without needing BCX themselves. They will get a list of all commands they have permission using by whispering '!help' ( ! instead of . ) to you.
> Note: Messages colored like this text can only be seen by you and no one else.
> 
> To dismiss this message, write '.he' and press 'Tab' to complete it to '.help', which will show you list of available commands.

# Development status

We have now been creating and maintaining BCX for almost three years and it has been over a year since we switched from active development to maintenance mode, but the situation is no longer sustainable for us.

We would like to thank all of you for your wonderful support!
When we first started working on BCX we never expected more than a tiny fraction of the playerbase to even know what it is and yet here we are. This wouldn't have been possible without you.

But the times change and so do we. The state of BC and the rapid changes demand too much of our spare time that keeps us from actually fun things.

**Therefore, we have to make the hard decision to let BCX stay mostly unmaintained from now on.**

On the bright side we also aren't simply going away. There is a certain secret project some of you may already know about... and that project is very close to being made public! Stay tuned for more details that are soon to appear on the BC Scripting Community discord!

~~Because of the current state of BC, the other projects we are working on (some not public yet) are much more fun for us.
Therefore, we are pausing development of new major features indefinitely.
We will however continue supporting BCX and make sure it runs well as new versions of BC come out.
We might also implement minor features and improvements to existing ones, but nothing is guaranteed.
We will however still be fixing reported issues.~~

~~By supporting us, you can make sure BCX stays maintained as BC continues changing, which sometimes means non-trivial work,
as BC can change a lot between versions. Thank you!~~

# About

BCX enhances the experience in the club with many new features, especially more options for slaves/submissives and their owners/dominant play partners.

The extension can, among other things, be considered a continuation of Ace's wonderful [cursed script](https://github.com/ace-1331/ace12401-cursedscript), providing similar features. Ace recently announced that the development of Curse will be stopped. Jomshir98, who was also a contributor to the cursed script's github, offered to take over the development to not let Curse die due to incompatibility with new club versions. At the same time, the goal was to remake the underlying design from the ground up, to make the script more future proof. Therefore, the decision was to integrate curse features into the bondage club extended script.

This has several advantages: There is no longer any need to install a browser addon and keep it up-to-date. BCX is a simple script, where the latest version can automatically be run with a loader in the console or via a browser bookmark (see section ['running the script'](#running-the-script)). Moreover, the new design will make it easier to configure and expand the extension with new exciting features. Configuration data is bound to your Bondage Club account and will be shared between different devices, but not between different accounts.

BCX is a complete remake of Jomshir98's previous [JMod](https://github.com/jomshir98/testing) which was basically all about testing features Jomshir developed for the bondage club, before they were even part of any bondage club betas, such as BEEPs with messages attached or icon-based room movement.

The extension is very modular and highly customizable. These are currently planned modules and their current development status:
